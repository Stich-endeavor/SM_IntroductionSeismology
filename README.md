# ðŸ‘‰ About the solver
I'm from South America and I have a BS degree in Geoscience. This is my attempt to demonstrate my commitment to both science (i.e. geophysics) and a foreing language (i.e. English). 
I want to devote my life to science so here I'm trying to make knowledge more accessible for anyone with curiosity or some troubles in this subject. 
Be aware that I'm not an expert, so do not hesitate in "Pull requests" or contact  me to perform some modifications or give some advice.
I'd like to ask to anyone who read these Python Notebooks (ipynb) to rate my english in order to improve my skills with this language.
